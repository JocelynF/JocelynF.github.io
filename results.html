	      Do volcanic eruptions exhibit seasonal patterns?
            </h2>
              <p>
                According to the Rayleigh test, volcanic eruptions do in fact exhibit seasonality especially when compared to the ... and ... phase.
				The P-Value from our Rayleigh tests were the following:
			  </p>
				<li>
					<ul>Fortnightly: 0</ul>
					<ul>Monthly: 0</ul>
					<ul>Semiannual: 0.17</ul>
					<ul>Diurnal: 0.24</ul>
					<ul>Semidiurnal: 0.58</ul>
				</li>
             
            <h2>
				(2) Which tidal force correlates the strongest with volcanic eruptions?
            </h2>
              <p>
                Based on our table above, the ... phase has the strongest correlation to volcanic eruptions.
  			  </p>
            <h2>
               (3) How well can we predict the phase at which a volcano will erupt based on volcanic and eruptive features?
            </h2>
              <p>
                Not very well. Considering the scores we received on the Random Forest test. The highest score was a ..., which is a 10% more than a random draw.  In addition, whenever we reran the test, the most relevant features varied widely, which lets us know that it was very close and not decisive.  Given that the classifier simply had to guess if the tide was on the low or high phase, this is not very promising.
              </p>
             <h2>
                (4) What are the specific volcano attributes that cause a volcano to be more susceptible to tidal forces? 
  			</h2>
              <p>
                From the results, the features that were most important were the dominant rock type, the crustal type and the ...  These all describe the composition of the volcano so there may be a strong type factor.
