				(1) Do volcanic eruptions exhibit seasonal patterns?
            </h3>
			<h4>
				Yes. Most of them do.
			</h4>
              <p>
                Volcanic eruptions do in fact exhibit seasonality when we plotted the eruptions at the time they occurred within the tidal phase. So now when we plot the number of eruptions that our occuring at different points in the phase, here are some interesting distributions we encountered:

			  </p>	
			  <p align = 'center'>
				<img alt='Tidal force' src='/images/fort_rose.png'/>
			  </p>	
			 <p>Our Rayleigh Test Statistics were the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Diurnal: 1.43 | P-value: 0.239</li>
					<li>Semi-diurnal: .542 | P-value: 0.582</li>
					<li>Semi-annual: 1.778 | P-value: 0.169</li>
					<li>Fortnightly: 13.614| P-value: 0.0</li>
				</ul>
             <p>
				The Rayleigh test gives a statistic, which we looked up in a table.  Based on that table, the fortnightly and monthly have p-values that are significantly less than .05 and the solar semiannual has a p-value less than .2.  Based on these results, we reject the null hypothesis that there is no unimodal distribution and go in favor of the hypothesis that a unimodal distribution does in fact exist.<br/><br/>

				The diurnal and semidiurnal tides fail the Rayleigh test, meaning that the test indicates that the distribution has a high probability of being uniform; however, when we look at the plots, they seem to have a slightly bimodal distribution, particularly the diurnal tide, which the Rayleigh test does not take into account.</p>
             <h3>
                (2) What are the specific volcano attributes that cause a volcano to be more susceptible to tidal forces? 
  			</h3>
			<h4>
				Dominant Rock Type and Tectonic Setting
			</h4>
              <p>
                The results varied for different phases, but as a whole, the features that were most important were the dominant rock type and the tectonic setting. Given that the type of volcano and how it was formed often times correlates to its eruptivity rate, these results are not suprising. The output of our code is as follows:
              </p>
			  <p>
				For phase type: Fornightly Phases<br/>
				Best Features: Tectonic Setting, Crust<br/>
				Best Score: 0.571<br/><br/>
				For phase type: Monthly Phases<br/>
				Best Features: Cat Elevation, Region, Crust, Dominant Rock Type<br/>
				Best Score: 0.435<br/><br/>
				For phase type: Semiannual Phases<br/>
				Best Features: Dominant Rock Type, Tectonic Setting<br/>
				Best Score: 0.579<br/><br/>
				For phase type: Diurnal Phases<br/>
				Best Features: Crust, Region, Dominant Rock Type<br/>
				Best Score: 0.479<br/><br/>
				For phase type: SemiDiurnal Phases<br/>
				Best Features: Region, Tectonic Setting, Dominant Rock Type<br/>
				Best Score: 0.512

           <h3>
               (3) How well can we predict the phase at which a volcano will erupt based on volcanic and eruptive features?
            </h3>
			<h4>
				Not extremely well, but better than no prediction power.
			</h4>
              <p>
                Considering the scores we received on the Random Forest test, it is very hard to predict volcanic eruptions when we examine the data from the standpoint that we used. We probably would have been better off using some form of Baye's Rule, however given the sparsity of eruptions for many volcanoes, we would not have the proper amount of data that we would need to build a really good classification model.  Hence, if we used Bayes' Rule, we would do something to the tune of:<br/><br/> What is the probability of an eruption occurring given that the volcano has feature X,Y,Z, is within this phase of the gravitational force and erupts according to this frequency.<br/><br/>The highest score was a .57, which does not given us a very good F1 score.

           <h3>
				(4) Which tidal force correlates the strongest with volcanic eruptions?
            </h3>
			<h4>
				Solar Semi-annual
			</h4>
              <p>
                The semi-annual phase correlates the strongest, which seems to suggest that volcanoes eruption rates correlate strongest to the semi-annual period.  This is consistent with visual histograms found in the studies that we first encountered when we embarked on this journey.
