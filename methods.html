			<h2>
              Overview
            </h2>
              <p>
                We used two primary statistical methods to answer the questions we wanted to answer.  We describe the motivation and rationale behind the use of these statistical tests and how they helped or hindered our project.
              </p>
            <h2>
              Rayleigh Test for Uniformity
            </h2>
              <p>
                The motivation and direction we could take this project in, hinged on our results to the first question:
              </p>
			  <p>
				<b></b>(1) Do volcanoes exhibit seasonality</b>
			  </p>
			  <p>
				Because our data is angular, it required the use of directional statistics to interpret. One of our modules used directional statistics in order to calculate the mean angle, mean vector (a measure of angular dispersion), circular standard deviation, and variance. We ultimately wanted to know if eruptions were occurring at various phases of tidal forces with equal probability or whether there are phases where more volcanoes are erupting.  
			  </p>
			  <p>

			  </p>
			  <p>				
				
				Therefore, we used the Rayleigh Test for uniformity to determine whether or not the data follows a von Mises distribution.  The von Mises, also known as the circular normal distribution, is very similar to the wrapped normal distribution.  Therefore, we can, in a sense, consider the Rayleigh test as a test for normality. An example von Mises distribution is the following:
			  </p>
			  <p>
				<img alt='von Mises distribution' src='/images/von_mises.png'/>
			  </p>
			  <p>

				If we believe that the relationship is unimodal, and hence normally distributed, then we should see little to no relationship in the data overall (when it comes to trends and patterns). However, if there is some form of a relationship, then we expect to reject the null hypothesis and argue in favor of the alternate that suggests that the data is less normal. (For our alternate) We will say that this suggests some sort of trend or hidden relationship in the data between erupton rate and phase.

            <h2>
              Random Forest Classifier
            </h2>
              <p>
                In order to determine the importance of the features, we decided to use a Random Forest Classifier. The reason being, a Random Forest Classifier uses a decision tree to randomly tests different subset of features. Through this random selection and separation of features, it arrives at an estimator that has a greater chance of "stumbling" onto the optimal decision boundary of a set of features. Given that our target variable is non-categorical we categorize it using "hacks" within Numpy and some functions native to Python.  Next, we employ the help of sklearn's Random Forest Classifier.  We were particularly keen on using this because it comes with a feature importance estimator that would allow us to see which features are most important.<br/><br/>Using the F1 score, we tested the power set of all features.
